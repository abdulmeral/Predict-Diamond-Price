# Predict Diamond Price
Diamonds... desired and expensive, diamonds are one of nature's most beautiful creations. It is the hardest mineral on the planet, no other mineral or substance can scratch it, on the other hand, it is very fragile, and it breaks easily.

Did you know that about 250 tons of gravel are needed to extract only one carat of diamond? And that 80% of the diamonds mined are used for industrial purposes?

Really cool facts, here in this notebook i am going to predict diamond prices using some regression algorithms, but before that, an exploratory data analysis will be done.
